nordic house

interface
    soil
        mics + piezos + transducers
    controllers (cling-film wrapped)
        sensel
        computer keyboard
        bela trill craft on hands
        python iml -> bela resonators?

â‰¤45 mins set
    patterns and sounds need to change
    and the mapping maybe or maybe not...
    doesnt have to be ravey though can be more ambient...
        but its just fucking hard to do that with superdirt!!!

physical setup
    plywood square/rectangle
    mic stand->manfrotto->webcam
    audio interface
    rocks and soil and ? terrarium?
    laptop for monitoring and mixing
        towels for wiping? one-handed?

add particles/attractors to IML?
    either by rendering onto pixel grid
    or adding onto the vector manually
    or as a separate IML?

iml mapping
    how to evolve the mapping - giacomo/victor conversation
        what was marco doing in his patch
        is that in the examples
        randomise
    storing rave latents that i like and then training with those
    victor was talking about zooming in?
    rave latents - lag?
    synthetic mappings
        could be more geometricaly constructed like a score
    sampled mappings
       ambient condition susceptibility
       on the fly / continuous would be ideal
    output size should maybe go down to like 2 for prototyping...
    osc send on change only (broadcast->event)

brio4k
    framerate?
    thresholding? 
    camera refocusing
    test in sun

rave
    python -> superdirt
    rave-tidal (superdirt)
        synthdef(s) for encoder/decoder
    review ferroneural max patch

sardine
    [x] port script back to sardine
    [ ] make some patterns
        use my samples
        copy from tidal?
    [ ] map the iml output to the patterns
        "control vector" master float list
        example output pairs for mapping
        let's say you have a 'track', these would be like macro controls
            could be semantic e.g. intensity|density|relaxed|...
        watch kindohm videos for inspiration?
    do some non-rave stuff
        V.s inside a swim? for patterning
    i have 0 confidence in making music with sardine


priorities
    iml -> sardine patterns

time
    create a sardine set: 6-8hrs
    create all the mappings: 4hrs
    buy soil, test in sun: 3hrs
    rave-tidal synthdefs: 1hr

tidal
    tidal-listener?


im tired
theres no way around it
what will i eat

thinking a lot about the input/output pairs now
thresholding probably a good idea
kinda wanna test outside tomorrow...

i dont have input/output pairs really...
creating a linear mapping
there's nothing wrong with that...

x x x x
x x x x
x x x x
x x x x

np to create the input data
cv2 to downsample to create the output data

its going to be like spatially semantic

ultimately you want soil<>trackstate

rave models is maybe simpler
but maps do need to be better still


hydra<>strudel IML bridge


i dont have time to map into all of the tracks
what about mapping to all
and replacing samples
and just making weird soundscapes
still need to test if I can get a linear IML response

ok so simple test doesnt work
what about more diverse sources

ok maybe starting to work
but i completely lack any intuition about this
and its not working well enough to use

so the question is whether i can do something much more basic with cv
like just averaging pixels in 4x2 cells and mapping those to an id function
(which is one of the lamest things ever lol)

rave birds would still be cool in a greenhouse

this is going absolutely nowhere
and its 5pm

where do i go from here
dont want to socialise
would love to cuddle

i am feeling sad
feeling like i failed (again)
feeling like im going nowhere with my 'research' and with my music
feeling lonely
on top of that i need to do
    [x] laundry
    [ ] eat
    keep working on the show


i really wanna chill the f out

what would be nourishing right now
